title: "Channel boosting based detection and segmentation for cancer analysis in histopathological images"
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/2015-10-01-paper-title-number-3
excerpt: "The human immune system plays a vital role in cancer prevention, with Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TILs) serving as key indicators of cancer prognosis. Manual counting of TILs under a microscope is labor-intensive, subjective, and time-consuming. To address this, we propose an automated diagnostic system called PVTCB-Lymph-Det. This system incorporates channel boosting with a Pyramid Vision Transformer and CBAM-enhanced ResNet-50 for effective feature extraction. It tackles the challenges posed by lymphocyte morphological variations, clustering, and artifacts. The model achieves an F-score of 88.92% for lymphocyte detection. PVTCB-Lymph-Det shows promise in assisting pathologists with accurate and efficient diagnosis."
