**CSCI 1170-006: Computer Science I (4 Credit Hours)**  
*Middle Tennessee State University ‚Äî Spring 2025*

**Course Description:**  
This foundational course introduces students to computer programming using a high-level language. Emphasis is placed on problem-solving through structured software development techniques and simple data structures such as strings and lists. The course uses the Python programming language in conjunction with UNIX tools for hands-on programming experience.

**Objectives:**  
- Develop students‚Äô skills in program design and construction.  
- Equip students with tools for algorithm development and debugging.  
- Teach structured programming principles through hands-on practice in Python.

**Topics Covered:**  
- Functional decomposition and structured programming  
- Algorithm design and procedural abstraction  
- Data structures such as strings, lists, and arrays  
- Python syntax and semantics  
- Use of UNIX tools for editing, compiling, and executing programs

**Learning Outcomes:**  
Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:  
- Apply functional decomposition in the design of a program.  
- Solve problems using algorithmic thinking with sequence, selection, and iteration.  
- Use simple data structures like arrays and strings within Python.  
- Write clean, readable, and syntactically correct Python programs.  
- Understand the syntax and semantics of core Python elements.  
- Use UNIX-based tools for compiling and debugging code.  
- Predict and trace state changes in a running program.

**Prerequisites:**  
A sufficient background in algebra and trigonometry (e.g., MATH 1730)
